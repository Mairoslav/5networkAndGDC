// MARK: 16. Summary

// 00:00 Congratulations on completing this lesson. We have covered a lot of material essential for working with any API. We learned how accessing web services is managed with API keys, we then used our knowledge of HTTP GET Request and learned about POST Request to implement each step in the authentication process.

// 00:22 We then saw an alternate way of validating request tokens, allowing users to log in via browser.

// 00:29 Finally, we learned about DELETE requests, and how we can log out of a session.

// 00:36 All of this means that our app users can now access their account from our app, delivering a personalized experience.

// 00:43 We will ee you in the next lesson where we'll use these account features as we build out the remainder of the Movie Manager.
