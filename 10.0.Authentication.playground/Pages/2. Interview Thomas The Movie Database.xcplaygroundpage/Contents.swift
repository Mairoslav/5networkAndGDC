// MARK: 2. Interview with Travis Bell (The crator of the TMDb): The Movie Database

// 00:00 We are going to be building an app that uses TMDb and its API. Can you tell us a bit more about yourself and THe Movie Database?

// 00:10 Sure. So I started TMDb seven years ago as a side project to help serve images to the media center community just as side project to help serve images to the media center community. And what what started off as literally just a website sharing Zip file, has turned out to be one of the most popular movie databases on the Internet.

// 01:41 Ludwig: Great, so what are some of the things we can do with The Movie Database?

// 00:42 Travis: seven years ago, when I started TMDb, we were just sharing images, and since than, obviously our database, our sevice has evolved a lot, and some of the cooler things we've added goes way beyond just searching for movies and finding filmography, an actor or an actress. We wanted to make it as easy as we could to let developers of any platform, you know mobile or even just other websites to plug in sessions and account features without ever having to worry about the backend, and that's exactly what most of our account service does.

// 01:27 Ludwig: Sounds like there's a lot we can do with TMDb. In order to use these features in our app and access the API, we need to create an account, let's do that next.
