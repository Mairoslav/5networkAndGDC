// 00:00 Here I am on the homepage of TMDb and I am going quickly through some of the account features we'll be using in our app. THis site might look slightly different for you, but that should be ok, all the functionality is the same.

// 00:15 I am going to start by searching for a movie. We have the search bar up here, and if I click inside, I can see a list of trending searches. I can also type in my onw query. Then if I click enter, we should see a list of search results. If I click one, I am taken to the main page for that movie. Just like in a Movie Manager App, we can add the movie to various lists.

// 00:37 The banner icon here adds it to my Watch list, and the heart icon here will add the movie to My Favorites list. I'll add it to both lists. To confirm I can go to my watchlist by tapping my profile image in the top right corner, and click Lists.

// 00:55 On the favorites tab at the top, we can see that movie has been added. Again this is exactly what do we do in the Movie Manager app, and we'll be using the same API endpoints to access these features that are used on the website. Take a moment to familiarize yourself with TMDb and add one or more movies to your Favourites and Watchlist.

// 01:13 This will come in handy later in this lesson.When you implement authentication in te Movie Manager app, you should see the movies that you added to your Favorites and Watchlist.
