// MARK: 5. Movie Manager Tour

// 00:00 By now, you should already be familiar with the movie database, create an account, and add movies to your favourite and watch list. And you should also have an API key for the movie manager. We are all set to start working with the nmovie database.

// 00:16 Let's revisit the Movie Manager app. The app you saw at the beggining of this lesson was the completed Movie Magager. In this lesson, we'll be starting with a partially working versionh of the App. However, the networking features like authentication are yet to be implemented.

// 00:32 To get started open up the project called "TheMovieManagerStarted" in the course repository. You'll see it looks like there's a lot going on, but this project is only a shell of the completed app. Let's take a moment to get familiar with what we have so far. Like the RanDog App, our files are divided into groups such as Model, View and Controller.

// 0:55: The Model group is where our networking code lives. The code for interacting with the movie database API is in this file, TMDBClient.swift. There are few things to note in the TMDBClients class.

    // 01:09 First, we have a static property for the API key... check project comments "TheMovieManager1"

/*
 // MARK: text under the video
 To open the starter project, open TheMovieManager.xcodeproj in the "Movie Manager Starter" directory in the iOS Networking Course Repository.
