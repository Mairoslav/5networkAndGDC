// 00:00 In the last lesson we learned about authenticatio and how our apps can access data, for the logged in user. This unlocks a range of possibilities, when working with APIs. In the Movie Manager, we now have the ability to access the user's data, offering a personalized experience in our app.

// 00:20 In this lesson, we'll build up the Movie Manager app to take advantage of the account features offered by the movie database. Specifically users will be able to search for movies, view the watchlist and favorite movies, and manage these lists by adding and removing movies.

// 00:41 We'll be making a lot of network requests to implement these features. This lesson will involve a combination of reading documentation, seeing worked examples and making network requests, as you add features to the Movie Manager. While many of the networking concepts may be familiar at this point, and there will be walk-throughs for each step, we have best seen that these concepts are best learned through repeated practice.

// 01:04 So you are encouraged to research documentation and implement the feature in your app before looking ahead. With practie these skills can be applied beyond the Movie Manager and can help you work with any web surface. There is a lot of look forward to, and by the end of this lesson you'll have a fully working version of the Movie Manager app.
