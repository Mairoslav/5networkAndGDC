// MARK: 14. Summary

// 00:00 You've implemented a lot of features in the movie manager. Users can view and manage a watchlist and favorites list, search for movies, and see poster images of their favorite movies. We're getting us to the point wher we can now call our app complete. But just because our app is working doesn't mean it's production-ready.

// 00:25 While much of networking is all about well-structured code and making HTTP requests, we also need to keep our user in mind, and there's still some work to do to provide the best user experience. I had a colleague look at the movie manager to provide feedback on what we have so far.

// 00:46 In the next lesson, we'll see what they had to say and start implementing best practices when working with networks. We have covered a lot. So take the time to pause and review, then I'll see you in the next lesson.
