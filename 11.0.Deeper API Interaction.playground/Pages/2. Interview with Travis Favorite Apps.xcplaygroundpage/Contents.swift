// 00:00 Ludwig: Before we get started building out the Movie Manager, let's hear from Travis one more time. So Travis, what kind of apps do you like to see? What makes a great app that uses the movie database?

// 00:14 Travis: You know honestly, anything and everything around movies, TV shows, actors, actresses. We have apps that let you keep track of personal watchlist, let you search your favorite movies and find out who was in that movie with so and so. 00:29 My favourite apps are the ones that combine a nice, sleek, well-thought-out interface, and tie-in all those account features that we make available via sessions. It's really awasome when you see your hardwork be taken by another developer and designer, and laid out on iPhone and you just see how that API powers the experience behind the scenes. And its so seamless and It's my job to make sure that it is seamless and that is just works. THe more we get to see of that, you know, the pretty mobile apps, websites, the better.

// 01:22 Ludwig: Thank you Travis, it seems like great mobile apps are both well designed and provide a personalized experience to their users. That's what we aim in this lesson as we built out our app to use the Movie Databases' account features. 

/*

 - Search for movies
 - View their watchlist
 - View their favorites list
