// MARK: 9. Your Turn: Improve the Movie Manager
// 00:00 We've spent a lot of time improving the movie manager, making our app mindful of user's limited data, handling slow connections, and providing informative error messages when things are going wrong. We've seen that networking on iOS is more than just creating a bunch of dataTasks, and that working with a network data presents many challanges of its own.

// 00:26 We could go on and on about improving the app one step at a time, and there's certainly more work to be done. For example, perhaps we could improve our code structure some more, and it sure would be nice if the user could stay logged in. These are the types of challenges that producton apps face, and it's your responsibility as the developer to address them to ensure the best possible experience.

// 00:49 We've provided a list of improvements to the movie manager, as well as the bugs that really users may encounter, and it's your task to implem,ent the necessary changes. You may even find bugs on your own or come up with additional improvements.

// 01:06 While you are not expected to implement every single change, this is the type of thing you'll do as a professional iOS developer. So I encourage you to pick a few improvements of interest to you and implement them in the movie manager. When you are done, be sure to share your approach with other students and to check out their improvements.

// MARK: Challenge
/*
 Now is your chance to take what you've learned and implement your own improvements to the movie manager.

 Head over to this GitHub issue tracker https://github.com/udacity/ios-nd-networking/issues and browse the possible improvements to The Movie Manager. Then, pick one or two improvements and implement them in the app. You may also find a bug and can create an issue to make your own improvements. When you're done, be sure to share your approach with other students by commenting on the issue.
