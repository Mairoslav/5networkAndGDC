//: ### Cleanup with Defer
//: The `defer` keyword is often coupled with error handling because it can be used to execute a block of code before an error-generating scope is exited.
//:
import Foundation

enum PurchaseError: Error {
    case invalidAddress
    case cardRejected
    case cartWeightLimitExceeded(Double)
    case insufficientStock(String)
}

func processOrder() throws {
    // throw PurchaseError.invalidAddress
    throw PurchaseError.cardRejected
}

print(".........................................func attemptPurchase()")

func attemptPurchase() {
    // before this function exits, execute this defer block
    defer {
        print("All Flash No Cash")
    }
    
    do {
        try processOrder()
    } catch {
        print(error)
    }
}

attemptPurchase()

//: - Callout(Watch Out!):
//: A defer block cannot contain code that changes the flow of control, like a break or return statement, or throwing an error.

 MARK: 15. Outro
 
 Way to go! Youâ€™ve finished this lesson on errors. To summarize, here are a few important notes about errors:

 Errors...

 - can be generated even when code is correct
 - must be handled or propagated and subsequently handled
 
 - may be handled by a "do-catch" block
 - may be converted into optional values using "try?"
 - can crash a program if generated when using "try!"
 
 - are automatically converted to "NSError" in handling code
 - can be custom; just implement the "Error" protocol
 - can be described more precisely using "LocalizedError" and "CustomNSError"
