//: Generic functions and types can specify multiple generic types, simply use a comma to separate them.
//:
// `Type1` and `Type2` can represent any type

    print("\(type(of: a)) & \(type(of: b))")

// combineUInt(integer, withString: "horses") // Error: Global function 'combineUInt(_:withString:)' requires that 'Int' conform to 'UnsignedInteger'

 MARK: 9. Outro
 
 You did it! You‚Äôve finished this lesson on generics. To summarize, here are a few important notes about generics:

 Generics...

 - allow developers to define functionality that should be applied to all or a specific set of types
 - power Swift arrays, dictionaries, and much of the standard library
 - can be used to define generic parameters for functions
 - can be used to define generic properties for types
 - can specify one or more generic types per function or type
 - are constrainable using a protocol or type
 - have a shorthand and longhand syntax
 - are extremely powerful when combined with extensions to specify functionality for a set of types
