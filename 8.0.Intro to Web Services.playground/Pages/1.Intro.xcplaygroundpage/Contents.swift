 // MARK: Intro
 
 00:00 In the last lesson we directly downloaded a single image from a static URL, our first network request in Swift. This is only begginging, your new ability to make network requests, just opens the door to using web services. Lots of companies offer web services, we can use to bring all kinds of data in our apps.
 
 00:25 Web services are often called MARK: APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). And many popular services provide APIs...
 
 
 00:33 Like the Twitter API, or Flickr API, and many companies haver their own APIs for their internal use. E.g. check Flickr API: https://www.flickr.com/services/api/
 
 00:40 Now that you know the basics of networking in Swift, it's time to exgtend our knowledge to start working with APIs.
 
 00:50 In this lesson, we're going to use a web service called The Dog API to show an image of a random dog. To do this, we'll expoore the Dog API's documentation, and along the waym we'll:
        - learn key concepts for working with any web API
        - see how APIs are organized into the end points,
        - how to request data from these endpoints,
        - and how to use a new data format called the JSON*, so our apps can receive and eventually send dta to web services. MARK: JSON*
        - how to organize our networking colde to conform to MVC Architecture.

 Text under the video:
 
 MARK: Lesson Objectives
 - Learn about the APIs provided by web services, and practice reading documentation for web APIs.
 - Understand the basic format of a JSON object.
 - Learn about JSON "parsing" and use the Codable protocol with JSONDecoder to parse JSON in Swift.
 - Refactor networking code out of the view controller, into its own class.
