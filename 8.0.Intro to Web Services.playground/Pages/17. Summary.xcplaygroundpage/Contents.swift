// MARK: 17. Summary

/*
 00:00 Wow, in this lesson you covered a lot and got first-hand exprience using a web service in an app.
 
    - we researched the web service to make sure that it met our needs,
    - got familiar with its endpoints,
    - requested data from one of them,
    - and parsed the JSON result.
    - finally, we refactored our code to separate our changing (or chainging?, what does he says?) asynchronous requests into methods with distinct tasks for better readability and architecture.
 
 00:32 This is just the introduction, and it takes practice to really get the hang of "consuming data" from APIs. In the next lesson called "consuming data", we'll keepworking on our app, making more API calls, and taking a deeper dive into JSON parsing with Codable.
