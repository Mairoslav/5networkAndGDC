// MARK: 3. Interview with Kaya Thomas: APIs and Web Services

/*
 00:00 So, in this lesson, we're going to use  a web service calls The Dog API. And developers often confuse the two terms:
 
        1. API
        2. web service
 
 00:11 But these are not the same thing, right? Can you talk a little bit abolut the diference between an API and a web service?
 
 00:17 So,
        
        1. API, an API is more like a documentation. So it gives you the map of what the method look like as well as the request and the response types.
        2. web service can contatin multiple APIs.
 
 That makes sense. So, I think in practice we're going to be doing more with APIs that just showing cute pictures of puppies. Can you talk a little bit about some of the practical applications of APIs that you have used?
 
 00:44 Sure. So, in Slack we have a platform which third-party developers can actually integrate into Slack. So, we have a bunch of public APIs that these third-party developers can use. For example, if you're developer building on Slack and you want to post a message into Slack, you would use the chat post message API. And outside of work for reread two, I use a bunch o APIs to actually get the book data.
 
 01:08 So, Goodreads has APIs that you can use to get information for any particular book. So those are some examples and there are so many ways to use APIs.
 
 01:21 Thanks Caya, there's a lot we can do with APIs and in this lesson, we're going to use The Dog API to see how we can integrate a web service into a iOS app.
