// Congratulations, you have learned a lot about making network requests and parsing JSON data. You have seen:

// how we can parso JSON even if our model objects follow a different structure

// how an entire JSON object or specific values can respresent Arrays

// how multiple JSON objects can be nested to form more complex JSON.


// More importantly, you've got a lot of practice using each parsing technique on your own. Working with networks data like JSOn is something you'll be doing alot when you egin building your own networked apps. Sure, getting compfortable with these concepts takes practice.

// To keep everytning straight, I've provided a JSON parsing cheat sheet for common JSON parsing techniques. Keep this as a reference, and you'll find that the same skills can be applied to working with any web API.

// Next up, we're going to dive deeper into networking concepts, going beyond simple get requests, and seeing how user data on web services is kept secure.
