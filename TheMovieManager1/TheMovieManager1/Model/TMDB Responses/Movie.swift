// 5. Movie Manager Tour, // 02:40 ... Movie is another struct that conforms to the Codable protocol (see/switch to Movie.swift file). THere were a lot of properties as well as a CodingKeys enum for each one. Its not important to know each of these properties, but I ahve linked the documentation below so that you can see how the Movie Results struct and the nested Array of Movies reflects the JSON responses structure.
// 5. Movie Manager Tour, // 03:22 We store our app data in MovieModel.swift file, move there...
