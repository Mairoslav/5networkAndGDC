This value is going to come from a search box and one of the view controllers, so we can't really access it here. However we can use our knowledge of associated values to produce the URL regardless of the serach String.
                    // 01:30 To use an associated value, I'll need to add it to the case name - see above in Endpoints I add (String) after case search. So this is going to be a String.
                    // 01:37 Then in the switch statement we provide a name for the value. Open the parentheses here and just say "let query". you have already see something similar when fetching the image for a specific breed in the RanDog app. F
                    // 01:48 Finally, we'll use String interpolation to pass the query in for our parameter via \(query) after =. This way we will be able to produce a valid search URL for anyu text that user types.

So, on the query String, I'll call ".addingPercentEncoding" - see it above under switch statement.
                    // 05:11 For allowed characters, there's a lot of options I can choose from, I am going to select ".urlQueryAllowed". If you run the app again, the search URL should be encoded correctly and you can find movies using multiple search keywords. Tapping one of the results, takes you to the DetailView. There is not much going on here yet - blank screen now. We just see the movie's title in the navigation bar. And the buttons down there (watchlist and like) don't actually do anything.
                    // 05:37 So next up, you'll use your knowledge of POST requests, so that users can use these buttons to add movies to the watchlist and fovorites list.

            return URL(string: stringValue)! // 03:55 I am not seeing the movie I want here so I'll add another word and wow, what happeded? It says: "Thread 1: Fatal error: Unexpectedly found nil while unwrapping an Optional value". It looks like our URL isn't getting created. When I added a space to type a new word to our search String, we built the URL and the search term was simply added using String interpolation. Unfortunately, URLs cannot contatin spaces. We tried to initialize a URL containing a space but we got nil instead. That doesn't mean we can't search for multiple keywords though. Let's see if the documentation can help.
            // 04:29 Here https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/search/search-movies I click on the "Try it out" sheet, to see how the movie database constructs URLs. I have added the parameter for the query String here (under query line on web it is possible to type in) and note that the query I pass in includes several spaces. Looking at the generaged URL, under the table of the web, take a look at how the query is handled. Instead of spaces, it simply says "%20". If you recall from earlier in the course, we saw these percent encodings produced in the process of generating URLs were not pretty. We can use them to handle special charactersa like spaces.
            // 04:59 Back here in the "TMDBClient.swift" let's use presenting codings to generate a valid URL. Swift provides a helpful method called "addingPercentEncoding" to do just that. So, on the query String, I'll call ".addingPercentEncoding" - see it above under switch statement.
