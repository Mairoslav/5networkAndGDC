And because we're accessing these UI elements on a completion handler that might be called in the background, we need to wrap this in a call to async (otherwise error: "UITextField.text must be used from main thread only"), adding the self keyword when we're accessing global properties i.e. self.emailTextField.text..., the same for passwordTextField.text and func handleLoginResponse that is in completion handler.

            // 03:20 you have just used your knowledge of GET and POST requests to go through the first authenticatioin flow for the Movie Database. And now that we have the session ID, we're able to start integrating more account features into the Movie Manager app.
